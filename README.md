# MPI-File-System
Message Passing Interface implementation for a simple file system

!IMPORTANT!
The makefile run commands are simulated locally at the university of crete and use the computer names and resources of the department. Will not do anything as is.
Change the computers you want to do the message passing according the MPI interface.
